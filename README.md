HTML
1. How to import fonts from the web. This was new and challenging to me since I had never attempted doing this before (I had always worked with pre-set founts)
2.  the table construct, specifically how to increase column and rowspace in a table to construct a complex table (this was challenging because I had to specifically think about how to order rows in the table header and in the table itself when unique table configurations were in place)
3. how to make nested ordered/unordered lists (I did not know how to nest lists/unordered lists)

CSS:
1. Implementing hover properties for links (i had never used any hover properties before so this was interesting to learn)
2. Using display configurations to format and center images on a page (I had never used dynamic layout and this was my first exposure to understanding that)
3. How to change the styling of an ordered list (I had never done this before and didn't realize the extent to which styling could be done on a list)
